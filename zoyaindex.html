            <p>

           My name is Zoya Khan and I am a MIS major in my 2nd year. I work at applied underwriters as a doc router in the 
		   underwriting department, in the past I have worked at First Data as a project management intern. 
		   In May I went to Orlando, FL for a vacation. In my mean time I like to read research articles and listen to music. 
		   When I was in grade school I used to play the violin.
